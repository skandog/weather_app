# Five Day Weather Forecast

Frontend challenge to build an app displaying five day weather forecast

[Demo](https://weather-app-skandog.vercel.app/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm start` or `npm run dev`
1. A Browser will open a new tab and navigate to `localhost:3000`

## Build

- run `npm run build`

## Testing

- `npm run test`

_Please Note: Testing suite has not been completed yet_

## Roadmap

This project has been completed in around four hours as part of a frontend challenge. And a challenge it was. While main user story has been completed there is a lot I would like to do with further time (and likelty will on a separate branch). These include:

- Convert day card to button which reveals detailed forecast for the day
- switch to custom weather icons rather than pulling from api
- Create backend to comunicate with external api
- Complete Testing Suite
- Further styling (stretch would be to have backgorund conditional on current weather)
- Night mode which applies depending on time
- Animation
- Refactor code into components for readability and reusability
